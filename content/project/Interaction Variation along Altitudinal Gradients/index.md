A synthetic understanding of how plant-pollinator networks change across environmental gradients is currently limited by heterogeneity in spatial, temporal and taxonomic grains. Further, new modeling and statistical tools are necessary to quantify the roles of neutral and deterministic factors in driving emergent patterns of spatial network change. This project addresses these gaps by developing a general framework of modeling and statistical tools, mobilizing data, and applying these to understand the effects of elevation on plant-pollinator interactions.
