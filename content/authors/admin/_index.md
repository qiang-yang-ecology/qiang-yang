I am a postdoctoral researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig. My research interests lie broadly in community ecology and macroecology, in particular in biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and stability. I am fascinated by the nature of the relationships among these properties, how they scale tropically and spatially, and how they are regulated by environmental change and human activities.

I also serve as one of the associate editors for the journal *Functional Ecology*.
