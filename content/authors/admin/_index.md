My research interests lie broadly in community ecology and macroecology, in particular in biological invasions, biodiversity patterns, ecological networks, and ecosystem stability. I am especially fascinated by how biodiversity and ecological networks scale tropically and spatially, and how they are regulated by environmental changes, human activities and biological invasions.

I also serve as one of the associate editors for the journal *Functional Ecology*.
